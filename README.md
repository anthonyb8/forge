# ðŸ”¨ Forge

**Forge** is a tool that scaffolds modern C and C++ projects.  
It helps you set up a project by selecting a:

- Compiler
- Build system
- Package manager
- Test framework

Then it wires everything together into a clean, ready-to-use structure.

Forge isn't a build tool or a package managerâ€”it's a setup assistant  
that gets you from zero to ready-to-code in seconds.
